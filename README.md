# Anomalous Time Series Detection

This repository contains a project focused on the detection of anomalous time series using machine learning models. The purpose of this project is to identify unusual patterns or deviations in time series data that may indicate outliers, unusual events, or errors.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately detect anomalous time series in a given dataset. This is achieved by using various machine learning models, such as autoencoders, and evaluating their performance based on different metrics.

## Key Findings

- **Data Preprocessing:** Successful handling of missing values, normalization, and feature extraction led to a cleaner dataset for model training and testing.
  
- **Model Selection:** Models such as autoencoders, Isolation Forest, and KNN were explored. The autoencoder-based model performed the best in detecting anomalies in this dataset, with an AUC score of 0.94.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluation metrics including AUC (Area Under the Curve), precision, recall, and F1 score were utilized to assess the models' performance. The autoencoder model demonstrated superior performance, with higher precision and recall than traditional machine learning models.
